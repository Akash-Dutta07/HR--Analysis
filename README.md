## üìù **CONCLUSION**


The analysis of the HR dataset provides critical insights into the organization‚Äôs workforce dynamics, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. While the company has a significant retention rate of 83.88%, the 16.12% attrition rate, coupled with a high proportion of bottom performers, signals the need for targeted strategies to enhance employee satisfaction and performance.  

The data also reveals a gender imbalance, with males constituting 60% of the workforce, and a high prevalence of overtime work, which could be contributing to dissatisfaction. Additionally, the significant representation in certain job roles, such as Sales Executives and Research Scientists, emphasizes the need to balance resources and workloads across departments.  

By addressing the key issues identified, such as performance management, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, the organization can create a more supportive and productive environment for its employees. This, in turn, can help reduce attrition, boost performance, and foster long-term organizational growth.
